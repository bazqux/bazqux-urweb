# Welcome to the Haskell Riak client

This library is a fast Haskell client for the
[Riak](http://www.basho.com/Riak.html) decentralized key/value data store.

It uses Riak's [protobuf API](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/references/protocol-buffers/) for
optimal performance.

This project was originally the work of Bryan O'Sullivan (<bos@serpentine.com>), and then [Janrain, Inc.](http://janrain.com/), it is now being maintained by Mark Hibberd (<mark@hibberd.id.au>).
