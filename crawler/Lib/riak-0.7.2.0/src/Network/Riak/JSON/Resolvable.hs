--
-- This module allows storage and retrieval of JSON-encoded data.
--
-- Functions automatically resolve conflicts using 'Resolvable'
-- instances.  For instance, if a 'get' returns three siblings, a
-- winner will be chosen using 'resolve'.  If a 'put' results in a
-- conflict, a winner will be chosen using 'resolve', and the winner
-- will be 'put'; this will be repeated until either no conflict
-- occurs or the process has been repeated too many times.
